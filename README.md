**Scriptlet Doctor** provides a workaround for [Gecko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_%28software%29) / [Goanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goanna_%28software%29)-based browsers (such as [Basilisk](https://www.basilisk-browser.org/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), [Pale Moon](https://www.palemoon.org/)) to allow inline scripts (scriptlets) inserted by add-ons, regardless of site restrictions. This can be particularly useful to overcome the limitations of blocker extensions, such as [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), on sites that have a strict content security policy ([CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)).

Please note that the way **Scriptlet Doctor** works reduces the overall resistance to [XSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting) attacks, although most sites on the Internet still do not impose strict CSP rules and nevertheless remain [fairly safe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting#Selectively_disabling_scripts). Yet you should not interfere with CSP policies unless absolutely necessary.

By default, **Scriptlet Doctor** is enabled for a predefined list of known domains with restrictive CSPs. You can edit this list in the settings, which can be quickly accessed with Ctrl + click on the extension button. It is strongly discouraged to enable **Scriptlet Doctor** for all domains, this option is intended solely for quick check the sites not yet added to the list.

**Installation packages** are located in the [releases section](https://github.com/JustOff/scriptlet-doctor/releases) and can be easily distinguished by file names: one for browsers using **classic** extensions (Pale Moon 27+, Firefox 45-56, etc.) and the other for Firefox **Quantum** (68+).
